# Card-Game-IOS
# It is a simple IOS game that matches pair of same cards and win if all cards are clear.

- The whole purpose for this project is to get used to writing swipe code, playing with the UI Library, and diving into IOS development. 

- This project is straight forward since I don't need to set up any database so no need to write my own service or even integrate any third party remote/local database framework. 

- Just directly playing around with the UI library and hook up these UI components to controller/Model to implement game logics 
 
*How to run the app
- you will need a Mac/Macbook and installed the newest xcode
- just clone the whole project and open Match App.xcodeproj
- simply crtl + b and then crtl + r to run the project and the simulator will automically pop up
